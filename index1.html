          <p>Zadeh was born in Baku, Azerbaijan SSR, as Lotfi Aliaskerzadeh, to Rahim Aleskerzade, an Iranian Azerbaijani journalist from Ardabil on assignment from Iran, and Fanya Korenman, a Russian Jewish pediatrician from Odessa and an Iranian citizen. The Soviet government at this time courted foreign correspondents, and the family lived well while in Baku. Zadeh attended elementary school for three years there, which he said "had a significant and long-lasting influence on my thinking and my way of looking at things." Despite being more fluent in Russian than in Persian, Zadeh sat for the national university exams and placed third in the entire country. As a student, he ranked first in his class in his first two years. In 1942, he graduated from the University of Tehran with a degree in electrical engineering, one of only three students in that field to graduate that year, due to the turmoil created by World War II, when the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union invaded Iran. Over 30,000 American soldiers were based there, and Zadeh worked with his father, who did business with them as a contractor for hardware and building materials.</p>
          <p>In 1943, Zadeh decided to emigrate to the United States, and traveled to Philadelphia by way of Cairo after months of delay waiting for the proper papers or for the right ship to appear. He arrived in mid-1944, and entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as a graduate student later that year. He received an MS degree in electrical engineering from MIT in 1946, and then applied to Columbia University, as his parents had settled in New York City. Columbia admitted him as a doctoral student, and offered him an instructorship as well. He received his Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Columbia in 1949, and became an assistant professor the next year. Zadeh taught for ten years at Columbia, was promoted to Full Professor in 1957. In 1959, Zadeh joined the faculty of Department of Electrical Engineering at University of California, Berkeley. Throughout his life-long research career, Zadeh has made two important, but rather distinct, scientific contributions: (1) linear system theory and classical control systems, and (2)fuzzy sets, fuzzy logic, and related science and technology. Zadeh's first important research contribution, well known among scholars of his generation in Electrical Engineering community, is actually in the area of classical control systems. His pioneer work, co-authored with Charles Desoer, ``Linear System Theory: The State Space Approach" laid a critical foundation for all modern approaches to system analysis and control. The second, and the most well known, contribution of Zadeh's research is his life-long dedication to the creation, enhancement, and the real-world impacts of a broad collection of science and technology that is based on fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic. He published his seminal work on fuzzy sets in 1965, in which he described the motivation (human-like reasoning) and detailed the mathematics of fuzzy set theory. In 1973 he proposed his theory of fuzzy logic. Together, fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic, provide the necessary foundations for a broad class of related innovations, including (but not limited to) the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>fuzzy control: a practical approach to non-linear control using fuzzy if-then rules in fuzzy logic</li>
            <li>fuzzy pattern recognition: generalizes conventional pattern recognition techniques using fuzzy sets (e.g., fuzzy k-means generalizes k-means clustering)</li>
            <li>fuzzy database: generalizes the classical database query language using fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic.</li>
            <li>fuzzy mathematics: generalizes conventional mathematics using fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic.</li>
            <li>neuro-fuzzy systems: a synergistic combination of fuzzy logic and neural networks, providing the first interpretable AI system based on neural network learning.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <blockquote><i><b>Lotfi Aliasker Zadeh</b> was a mathematician, computer scientist, electrical engineer, artificial intelligence researcher and professor emeritus of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. Zadeh was best known for proposing fuzzy mathematics consisting of these fuzzy-related concepts: fuzzy sets,fuzzy logic, fuzzy algorithms,fuzzy semantics, fuzzy languages,fuzzy control,fuzzy systems, fuzzy probabilities, fuzzy events, and fuzzy information. Zadeh was a founding member of the Eurasian Academy.</i></blockquote>
